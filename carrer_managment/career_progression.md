# Career Management

![career progression](./images/career_progression.png)

## Overview


## Principles
 (WIP)

1. More segmentation allows for more promotion events and decreases how 
2. Decouple salary as much as possible from senior leadership levels
    * Salary ranges are wider as you progress
3. Engineering Pendulum is preferred and salary ranges should help support it.
4. Architecture is a skill not a role. 
5. ICs should report to peer or more senior levels of engineering management
6. Salary 
    * Base pay -- logrithmic growth
    * Bonus -- based on company performance and linear growth
    * Equity -- conversely grows relative to Base pay
