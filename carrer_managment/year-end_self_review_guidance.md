## Think about the following as you write:  
1. How does your review relate to expectations for developers
    - Focus on impact. If you did a training or got a certificate, what was the impact of your efforts. Measured self-improvement is also impactful!
    - The idea of "exceeding expectations" (or more) is about framing how your contributions relate to a more senior role or delivering consistent, differentiated value. However, if you don't articulate how you are consistently meet expectations it is hard to conclude you exceed them. 
    - Expectations are more guiding than instructive. This work is more dynamic and hard to œmeasure by some sort of checklist.
    - Think about how you talk about consistent execution over specific successful instances of execution. 
2. Support your claims with **specific feedback from colleagues**. If you are not collecting feedback, start! Outside of performance reviews it is invaluable to your individual growth as a professional. 
    - Independently written feedback is preferable to self-reported feedback when telling a story about your growth.
    - You might have to ask a follow up question to peers to get more specific feedback. Remember this is not a strong muscle generally at Grainger and you should take ownership over this exercise. 
3. Value **brevity** in your writing, verbosity can dilute your message. 
4. Use AI to provide feedback on what you have written and help your analysis. Just make sure to avoid AI hallucinations.
5. **This process does not define your value as a person.** It is an imperfect process that tries its best to  negotiate and validate an employment relationship.

## Contents of the self review (limit to at most 2-pages):
*Quality over length*

1. Impact Analysis. Articulate the experiences that highlight your impact and relevant feedback from peers. The most powerful stories are the ones that demonstrate growth. Be specific as possible and value facts over your conclusions of your own work.
 - This is the primary framing of the Career Architecture
2. What are your top 3 areas for growth and why?
- Ideally, observations from your peers have given you insight into this growth. 
3. What strength do you feel is under utilized?


## Notes/Observations on this template
1. I tried asking people to rate themselves. On a 1-10 scale, they will rate themselves a seven. It doesn't yield an interesting metric
2. People will focus on the serious of things they did and less on the impact. 
3. People don't generally manage their feedback.
