lens for thinking about this progression: [Know your “One Job” and do it first](https://charity.wtf/2021/03/07/know-your-one-job-and-do-it-first/)

*The following is largely an additive traversal and outlines example signals (not exclusive).*

## **SE1 - Curious IC and constantly seeking to understand**
*Aptitude and attitude are most important. You should seek to validate everything you know with those around you.*

## **SE2 - Strong IC and delivering work in front of them.**
*Your sphere of influence task delivery (or stories)*

- you can independently make a high quality change to the system. You could anchor on a card.
    - signal: you rotate pairs without missing a beat
    - signal: you can effectively manage “other” requests and the work in front. Said differently, you switch pairs instead of your standup update being “I helped this pair with their work”.
- expertise with technology used in the team. This includes language proficiency and framework/tool usage
    - signal: you can explain why something is broken in Spring
- execution with test-driven development, continuous integration, and continuous delivery
    - signal: you can identify anemic tests and refactor them.
    - signal: your commit log is small, deployable changes pushed to main.
    - signal: you can break down most work in front of you into smaller chunks.
- clear communication about technical delivery updates, blockers, and questions both in written and verbal formats
    - signal: standup updates on consistently clear and well thought out.
- understanding of team’s mission, near-term goals and your current task
    - signal: you can identify when something does not align with our near-term delivery objectives
- fluency with local development tooling, build pipelines, deployment targets, observability tools
    - signal: you know how to use git
- provide regular written feedback to your peers and forward to the engineering manager.
    - signal: there is some form of written communication the EM can see
- you collect, reflect and manage your feedback
    - signal: you bring things up in a 1:1
    - signal: you have some structure to aggregate this information

## **SE3 - Strong IC that impacts the team**
*Your sphere of influence expands to the team how we can execute work.*

- application of generally accepted, software technical principles and patterns
    - signal: you educate the team or refactor some code to accomplish this. This could be something like calling out a “magic string”
- expertise with local development tooling, build pipelines, deployment targets, observability tools
    - signal: you can fix the mechanics of a broken pipeline
    - signal: you introduce a deployment strategy that leverages the existing tools in a particular way
- facilitation of team meetings that yield specific, fruitful outcomes
    - signal: someone thanks you for clarity from a meeting
    - signal: you generate artifacts that are referential later, like a post-mortem
- provide feedback about team execution of sensible defaults:
    - signal: you have examples of corrective measures.
- fluency with architecture and have the ability to reason about architectural trade-offs
    - signal: you can spot an architectural smell and why
- proficient at time management with story work and side quests.
    - signal: you ask questions about how to spend your time and act accordingly
    - signal: your pair does not provide feedback that you feel absent from the work

## **SE4 - Exemplifies technical defaults and impact spans outside the team**

*Your sphere of influence expands to the other senior technologists working adjacent to the team and our non-technical stakeholders.*

- understanding of domain’s mission, near-term goals and how the system is changing in broad strokes
    - signal: you can articulate architectural changes in the context of the bigger picture
- own the architecture of a solution with buy-in and feedback from others
    - signal: we execute a series of cards based on your work
- scaling yourself. You take action to scale your knowledge and influence by more than bringing up ideas in a team meeting.
    - signal: you put together an internal blog post or tool
- influence delivery management to drive the team to small, iterative stories that prioritize value of function
    - signal: you have broken down an epic into a set of stories
    - signal: you refine a story to be more value-oriented.
- coaches and mentor fellow team members with regular direction and input to other team member’s growth
    - signal: you can report back on some team member’s growth
- expertise in designing an interfaces (event stream, http, whatever)
    - signal: you can identify a leaky abstraction
- navigates complexity and ambiguous tasks through questioning and determination of the correct course of action
    - signal: you are asked to evaluate a technology you have never seen before, you proceed to model that work as a series of spikes, determine if we should delegate to the team or you need a multi-day side quest.
- acts as a “go-to” engineer for technical problems, despite your level of expertise.
    - signal: someone asks you a python question you have never heard of but you know someone that knows the answer or you can help them track it down given analogous experiences.
- proficient at time management and prioritization of your work.

## **Appendix**

1. Feedback – your manager should help with feedback collection and reflection. It is imperative that you develop the ability to provide this in a written format to each other. This forces you to commit to your words and iterate on what you focus on. The context of the feedback can be oral or written but the important thing to document is the useful kernel of feedback.
