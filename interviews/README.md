## Pair programming inteview approaches

I think that #3 yields the best, most consistent experience when you use a generic problem internal interviewers know well.

1. **Platforms like CoderPad, HackerRank, HackerEarth etc.**
* There can be limitations on the types of problems you can orchastrate and use of testing frameworks.
* The browser IDEs are nice but can be awkward for candidates.
* It can provide standardizaion across the organization and can require less work for recruiting efforts.
2. **Provide scaffolded project possibly with stub**
* This has a higher maintenence cost of this code and it can easily get out of date. This cost scales linearly with the amouunt of code written.
* You can have more flexibity on the style of problems you can use.
* You risk execution not working on a candidates machine or having issues.
* A limited scaffolding can cause more confusion for candidates about how to deal with mocks or stubs.
3. **Provide a prompt and some "homework"**
* The amount of "homework" can drive some inequity in the process because not everyone has the time to spend a bunch of time on a coding problem. 
* There is more coordination cost with the candidate and possible variability in the interview.
* This can enable a more realistic problem and lower maintenance cost of interview materials.
* This can weed out more senior developers who are not curious.
